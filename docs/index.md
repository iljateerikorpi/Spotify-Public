## About the Project

The point of the project is to track, analyze, and visualize my Spotify listening habits to showcase skills in Python, Excel, and Power BI.
The project started because I wanted to have a deeper insight into my Spotify listening habits, but outside from the annual Spotify wrapped, Spotify does not share any data.
The solution was to implement automatic tracking of songs I listened to and gathering my own data.

## Features

The main feature of the simple command-line application is to enable the user to fetch recently played songs and store them in a database.

You can also use the SpotifyManager class to run a script that only fetches and stores the tracks without any interaction. This way you can automate the process.

The command-line application does however offer a couple of additional tools that can be useful:
- View all the users owned playlists.
- Download a playlist to a csv file.
- Create a playlist from a csv file.
- Delete a playlist.
- Save top items to a csv file.
- View last played tracks (up to 50).

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core application, including command-line functionality and backend processes, is developed in Python, utilizing the Spotify API for data extraction.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight SQLite database is used for data storage, eliminating the need for external hosting.
- **Excel:** Employed for comprehensive data analysis and reporting.
- **Power BI:** Used for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.

The application code is available on GitHub: [iljateerikorpi](https://github.com/iljateerikorpi)

## Results

For privacy reasons, the entire dataset will not be displayed. However, select insights and analyses from November 2024 will be showcased to demonstrate the project's capabilities.
